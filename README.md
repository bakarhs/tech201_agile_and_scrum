## Agile and Scrum notes

### What is Agile and what are the benefits of using agile?
 
Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches.

The Agile Manifesto consists of four key values:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.

2. Working software over comprehensive documentation.

3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.

4. Responding to change over following a plan.

Agile software development is a methodology that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. Some benefits of using an agile approach include:

1. Faster delivery of working software
2. Increased collaboration between cross-functional teams
3. Greater flexibility to adapt to changing requirements
4. Continuous feedback and improvement throughout the development process
5. Greater ability to manage and prioritize competing demands
6. Increased visibility and transparency into the development process
7. Emphasis on delivering working software, rather than just documentation
8. Improved communication and teamwork among team members
9. Greater customer satisfaction through early and frequent delivery of working software.

### How does agile fit into DevOps?

Agile and DevOps are both methodologies that focus on improving the speed and quality of software development. Agile is a project management approach that emphasizes flexibility and rapid iteration, while DevOps is a set of practices that emphasizes collaboration between development and operations teams to improve the overall efficiency of the software development lifecycle. Agile and DevOps are often used together to create a fast, flexible, and efficient development process. Agile provides a framework for iterative development and continuous improvement, while DevOps provides a set of tools and practices for automating and streamlining the deployment of software updates. Together, they can help teams to deliver software faster, with fewer errors and greater reliability.

### Benefits for a business that implements DevOps

### What is SCRUM

### Differences between Agile and SCRUM

### User story and Epic Story

### The SCRUM Framework

### What are Artifacts?

Artifacts in Scrum are the tangible, visible products that are created throughout the Scrum process. Artifacts are used to help the Scrum team understand the current state of the project, and to help them clear and track progress. 

The Product Backlog is a list of all the features and requirements that the product needs to have in order to be successful. The Sprint Backlog is a list of all the tasks that need to be completed during a Sprint.  Increment is the sum of all the completed work from the sprint, and is used to measure progress and success.

Artifacts in Scrum are an essential part of the process, as they provide visibility into the progress of the project and help the team plan and track their work. They are also used to help the team communicate and collaborate, as they provide a shared understanding of the project and its goals.

### Pillars of SCRUM
The three pillars of Scrum are transparency, inspection, and adaptation.
Transparency is the foundation of Scrum and is based on the idea that all stakeholders should have visibility into the progress of the project. This means that all stakeholders should be able to see what tasks are being worked on, who is working on them, and how much progress has been made.
Inspection is the process of regularly reviewing the progress of the project and making sure that it is on track. This includes looking at the progress of individual tasks and the overall project, as well as assessing the quality of the work and making sure that it meets the standards set out by the team.
Finally, adaptation is the process of making changes to the project as needed. This could include changing the scope of the project, adjusting the timeline, or even changing the team members. This ensures that the project is able to remain flexible and responsive to changes in the environment.

### How to effectively gather requirements?

### SCRUM Roles and Teams

### DoR and DoD

### 3 Amigos

Three Amigos approach, which combines the perspectives of business, development and quality assurance for sprint planning and evaluation.

### 3 C's

The "3 C's" in Agile refer to:
1.    Card: A visual representation of a user story or requirement, often written on sticky notes.
2.    Conversation: Regular face-to-face communication between team members, stakeholders, and customers.
3.    Confirmation: Verifying that the work completed meets the customer's expectations and requirements.
